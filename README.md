A Brief Tour of Evernote Business
=================================

This is a short Python application designed to demonstrate simple interaction with the [Evernote Business API](http://dev.evernote.com/documentation/cloud/chapters/business.php). Specifically, this application performs the following tasks:

1. Authenticate to Evernote Business.
2. Display all Business notebooks to which the current user has been granted access.
3. Create a new Business notebook.
4. Link the new notebook with the current user's account (so that it's available in the Evernote client applications).
5. Creat a sample note in the new Evernote Business notebook.

How to run
==========

```sh
$ PYTHONPATH=./evernote-sdk-python/lib python main.py
```
